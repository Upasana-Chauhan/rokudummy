#
# Important Notes: 
# To use the "install" and "remove" targets to install your
# application directly from the shell, you must do the following:
#
# 1) Make sure that you have the curl command line executable in your path
# 2) Set the variable ROKU_DEV_TARGET in your environment to the IP 
#    address of your Roku box. (e.g. export ROKU_DEV_TARGET=192.168.1.1.
#    Set in your this variable in your shell startup (e.g. .bashrc)
